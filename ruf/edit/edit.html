 There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing.

      Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <span class="itc"> &lt;p&gt; </span > element inside a <span class="itc"> &lt;div&gt; </span > element, and the user clicks on the <span class="itc"> &lt;p&gt; </span > element, which element's "click" event should be handled first?

      In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <span class="itc"> &lt;p&gt; </span > element's click event is handled first, then the <span class="itc"> &lt;div&gt; </span > element's click event.

      In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <span class="itc"> &lt;div&gt; </span > element's click event will be handled first, then the <span class="itc"> &lt;p&gt; </span > element's click event.

      With the addEventListener() method you can specify the propagation type by using the "useCapture" parameter:
