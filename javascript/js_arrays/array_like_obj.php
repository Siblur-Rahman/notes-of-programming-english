<h2>What is Array-like in JS?</h2>
<div class="code_p">
An array-like is an object. Has indexed access to the elements and a non-negative length property to know the number of elements in it. These are the only similarities it has with an array. Doesn't have any of the Array methods like push, pop, join, map, etc.
